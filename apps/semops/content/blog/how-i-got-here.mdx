# How I Got Here

I've been a product manager building data-driven software for virtually my whole career. Over the last decade, my focus moved deeper into data systems, analytics, machine learning, and the early edge of AI. By the end of 2023, I was ready for a break and took a year off entirely from work — with every intention of recharging and going back to a normal job.

By early 2025, I couldn't help jumping into the AI space. I started with a vague goal to "figure this stuff out" and a sense that this was where my career would go, but no clear plan. After some months of unstructured exploration, a few ideas verging on goals started to emerge.

## Path to Understanding

I wanted to really *understand* not just the technology, but its implications, and as it turns out, *understanding* itself.

First, I would need to work top-down and bottom-up simultaneously. Top-down meant understanding the big picture from the perspective of markets, businesses, operations, and customers. Bottom-up meant getting technical with the underlying infrastructure — python, agents, RAG, models, data-ops, deployment, scale, etc.

Second, I would ensure that I was coming away with robust and applicable skills and knowledge. A career span through several big tech shifts taught me that it's important to filter signal from noise in a fast-moving zeitgeist space. For top down, this meant I would dig down to foundational business principles. For bottom up, I would focus on neutral capabilities, not specific tools or methods. So, I committed to open source and open standards wherever possible, and generally "doing things the hard way". This is because open methods expose the underlying mechanics and primitive components rather than "ease of use" through proprietary abstractions. I soon concluded that "the hard way" was the opposite when it came to creating real solutions.

Third, I would need real-world validation. I took on some consulting clients through word of mouth, and what I found validated assumptions I'd been forming. Every company had significant data challenges to address before they could meaningfully integrate AI, which wasn't surprising. What was surprising was how much AI could accelerate the data work itself.

I found myself at first doing some fairly significant (for a PM) data engineering and data science work with agentic coding and context engineering. That led to building out a few agentic tools that could diagnose, fix, and validate some common problems. That experience led me to consider "boring" governance processes like profiling, provenance, and lineage as powerful and essential AI companions. I also confirmed an early assumption, which is that AI is powerful analytics, but it's analytics, and it inherits every existing challenge associated with analytics and data systems along with quite a few new ones.

## The Shift

Then, I started thinking about what other kinds of tooling, agents, and automation I could create that would have broader value. How much of a force-multiplier could AI be for — well — a product manager with some data and AI chops.

Meanwhile, I continued to watch and research the market and AI space in general, and I kept arriving at the same conclusion: New SaaS solutions that employed AI were often half as impressive as open source solutions on GitHub. Agentic coding, and specifically, Claude Code became the most impressive application of AI I'd encountered. So I put my product manager hat back on and started to think more about strategic value and broader impacts. I started to work on "context engineering" workflows as if my agents were a matrixed, cross-functional organization. I made data and structure first class, and ended up "vibe-architecting" my way into Domain Driven Design. Then something concrete started to take shape.

## The Framework Emerged

Without quite realizing it, I was building what would become the Semantic Operations Framework. Once I could see the outlines of the core ideas, I kept going and began to work through concrete solutions to real-world challenges.

The framework evolved from synthesizing what I was learning across every dimension, suggesting that AI can be an accelerator, but you need the right conditions. My conclusion is that the conditions that make AI work well are the same conditions that make organizations and systems work well, regardless. Both depend on shared, explicit meaning - semantics.

That's what Semantic Operations is about. [What is SemOps?](/about)
