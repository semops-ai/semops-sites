# Semantic Optimization

Semantic Optimization is where AI becomes a powerful partner in converting typical business systems and processes into measurable improvement and growth. This is where there are genuinely new concepts and technical solutions.

A business can measure coherence at the levels that matter — where decisions are made — and as a byproduct, capture much of their previously unseen enterprise data for use with AI. A coherent state then enables growth in bigger steps by employing AI for what it's really good at and using patterns as a unit of growth.

The coherence-growth cycle can continue in repeating cycles, because the governance of decisions — what and why, technical or otherwise — is encoded in the data, architecture, and AI/ML operations.
