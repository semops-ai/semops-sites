# Strategic Data

Strategic Data addresses how organizations think about and manage data as a strategic asset. The premise: if you understand your business domain — your industry, your product, your surfaces — then the data requirements, systems, and investment are knowable.

Most data failures aren't technical; they're organizational — fragmented ownership, missing literacy, schema treated as afterthought rather than business logic. Strategic Data provides techniques for neutral understanding of data systems, along with concrete methods for governance, diagnostics, enabling data systems for AI, and managing the new types of data that AI creates.
