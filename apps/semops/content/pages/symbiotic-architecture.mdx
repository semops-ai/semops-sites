# Symbiotic Architecture

Symbiotic Architecture addresses how systems, organizations, and business domains align. It applies Domain-Driven Design (Evans, 2003) as an ideal foundation for Semantic Operations and AI.

Symbiotic Architecture promotes drawing clear boundaries around objects that are meaningful business components, readily understandable by humans, and consumable by data systems and AI. Architecture that's symbiotic with AI means businesses can build simplified systems aligned to their domain, detached from inflexible and AI-challenged enterprise systems.

And there's a flywheel effect — AI accelerates the work of encoding domain structure, and that structure makes AI more effective, a compounding cycle that Semantic Operations methods are designed to sustain.
